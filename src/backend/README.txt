STRUCTIONS

If you are using Pycharm

Run the following command (wherever you want the project to be)
$ git clone https://github.com/PrajnyaPrabhu19/CS180-khsp.git

It will create a CS180-khsp folder


After the folder has been cloned, open up PyCharm and create a new project. This new project must be in \CS180-khsp\src\backend (from the previous step)
Click on create project;
You will get a prompt that says "The directory \CS180-khsp\src\backend is not empty. Would you like to create a project from existing sources instead?"
Click NO

Now, you should have a new PyCharm project with a venv folder.
Now in the Pycharm terminal execute the following command to install dependencies (only flask for now)

$ pip install -r requirements.txt

Once this is done, we should be good to go. Run the main.py to check if everything is running fine
